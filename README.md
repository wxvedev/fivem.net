# fivem.net redesign

Hello ðŸ‘‹, I would like to get this pushed to the CFX team in the attempt to deploy a new and official version of the [FiveM](https://fivem.net) web.

It does not have to be this version, in fact I believe there are improvements to be made to the design, and especially the code as I focused on getting the design process done first.

I will end up going through the codebase within the next couple of days and clean everything up.

I encourage any feedback and/or proposals.

To get in contact with me, send me an email to wxvedev@gmail.com or dm me through [discord](https://discord.com/users/1294711660442947635)

The captures didn't come out how I liked due to the quality being low (for some reason).
