For some reason the captures came out low quality, meaning buttons, for example will look weird.

Run on local to see properly or [visit the page](https://fivem-web-redesign.vercel.app).

## NOTE:

The code inside this repo is far from perfect, I just worried about the design aspect.

Will end up going through it within the next couple of days and organize it.
